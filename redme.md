#Notes:
* I know, there should be done some things better to provide fully responsible code, but for now, I am stopping the development because the time, which I have spent with code writing definitely exhausted estimated time 4h.
* In the real world task I suggest provide dealing with MAX_DOUBLE limitations, provide javadoc, thing about writing better readme file :-)
